# W-LSTMix
W-LSTMix—a lightweight, modular hybrid forecasting model designed to generalize effectively across diverse building types. With only \textbf{∼ 0.13 M} parameters, W-LSTMix integrates wavelet-based signal
decomposition, the ensemble strength of N-BEATS, the gated memory of LSTM, and the patch-mixing efficiency of MLP-Mixer to enable efficient building-level load forecasting.
